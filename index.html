				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: .9em;"><i>I am currently a Senior pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology at Florida State University.</i></p>

				<p>I am a motivated individual interested in many aspects of Information Technology, from consulting to development. I chose to work during school to gain
					as much experience as possible, alongside my degree. I've learned valuable lessons in management due to my position as IT manager for a local bartending business.
					<br></br>
					I've undertaken a variety of projects with a large amount of responsibility in all of them. Everything from nested if-statements in Excel spreadsheets
					to online ordering forms, I've learned how to excecute solutions to improve a business. While my organization does not require very advanced IT skills,
					it is a great learning experience.

				<h3>HelpDesk Technician - FSU College of Communication and Information</h3>
				<p> 
					My role as a HelpDesk Technician has allowed me to learn more about Mac OS and Bash scripting, something I normally
					would never have undertaken. Although I strongly prefer Windows and Linux operating systems, I took on the responsibility
					of managing MacOS adminstration and deployment of FSU's CCI college.
					***********ADD PIC HERE***********
					<br></br>
					I ressurected the antqiuated deployment scheme into a modern, flexible deployment workflow. Using Deploy Studio, fellow HelpDesk Technicians are able to image faculty Mac computers and student computer lab systems
					with ease. Combining Deploy Studio's workflows and an in-house bash script, my new deployment scheme vastly improved Mac deployments.
				</p>
				<h3>IT Manager - On the Rocks Bartending</h3>
				<p>I began my On the Rocks career as a bartender, and worked my way up to managing 30+ employees, developing a system that is responsible for $30,000+ of event orders,
					and handling all Gsuite and domain administration. My first task was to create a complicated Excel spreadsheet for estimating alcohol costs for clients. This tool
					was a big success, and I utilized what tools I had, which was Excel. Today, I might have made it into a web application for portablity, but the system worked. 
					<br></br>
					My next large task was to revamp email adminstration. The owner of On the Rocks was paying way too much to an IT consultant for hosting email services. I took control of all the 
					domains and handled a large email migration to Gsuite, which was a scary endeavor. I couldn't afford to lose any of the thousands of emails accured over the years. Since migrating to Gsuite,
					I have been able to improve secruity and save On the Rocks hundrends of dollars a year. 
					***********ADD PIC HERE***********
					<br></br>
					Lastly, my biggest endeavor was an online ordering form. On the Rocks has an older, and technologically slower, clientbase. What I built had to be extremely user friendly,
					from the customer's point-of-view, and the business'. If our Office Coordinator could not easily access client's data, the system would go unused.

					I built an online ordering form that is clean and responsive.
