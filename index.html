    <p>I am currently a senior Information Technology student at FSU. I have developed a large
        passion for Linux, at work and at home. I have strongly expanded my technical skills
        while working at the FSU College of Communication and Information HelpDesk, while I have grown
        my management skills while working at On the Rocks Bartending.

        <h5>Arch</h5>
        <p>Running Arch Linux as my main OS has been a phenomenal learning experience. 
        Having to manually install and configure every package on my machine has given me an
        incredible level of control. Everything from configuring a USB device to setting up a printer
        can turn into a learning experience, whether you like it or not.

        <span><img src="img/sssd.png" alt="SSSD" /></span>
        <h5>SSSD</h5>
        <p>SSSD, or System Security Services Daemon, is a way to incorporate Active Directory logons into Linux servers, also known as Single Sign-On.  Setting up SSSD was my first major
            Linux related project for work. I quickly realized the importance of documentation in a large project, and attempted to keep the scope
        of the original project in mind. I wrote a Bash script (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/wbollock/CCIAutoEmail">a language I often rely on...</a>)
    to automate the installation process, the removal of LDAP, and a host of other verifications and checks. A link to the Bash script is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="    https://github.com/wbollock/cciSSSD_AutoInstall/blob/master/runSSSD.sh">here</a>.</p>

        <h5>On the Rocks Bartending</h5>
        <p>
        On the less technical side, I am the manager of 30+ bartenders at a local event bartending company, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ontherocksbartending.net">On the Rocks</a>.
        While in this role, I managed expensive and large events for over two years. These required proper planning, communication, and execution. My technical roles transitioned towards
        easy G-Suite Administration, domain name upkeep, and adding features to an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ontherocksbartending.net/schedule-an-event-today">online ordering form</a>.

        <h2>Side Projects</h2>

        <span><img src="img/plex.png" alt="Plex Server"/></span>
        <h5>Plex Server</h5>
				<p>I run a personal Plex and FTP server at home. 
                    An old cryptocurrency miner, my server is currently running Ubuntu. I've also installed Pihole and Home Assistant (through Docker) on a spare
                Raspberry Pi. </p>
                    <br>
				<span><img src="img/payroll.png" alt="OTR payroll program"/></span>
				<h5>Java Payroll Program</h5>
				<p>I wrote a small Java program to test advanced Java techniques, like
                    encapsulation, interface, abstract methods, and polymorphism, that also
                    helps me pay 30+ employees every two weeks.
