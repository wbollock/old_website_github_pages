        <h3>William Bollock Career Portfolio - Experience</h3>
        <p>Thank you for completing my coding challenge! Sadly, Github Pages can't run PHP, so I can't verify your
                answers. Let's hope they're correct.
        </p>
        <h3>Career Goals: Linux Sysadmin</h3>

        <h3>OpenBiblio</h3>
        <p>To give you an example of my programming experience, I will be walking you through my work on OpenBiblio for PHP7.0.</p>
        <p>OpenBiblio is a library system that is free and open source. The web application was outdated, and ran only on PHP5 and an outdated MySQL version.</p>
        <p>My work is here, <a href="https://github.com/wbollock/openbiblio_7.2_php7">released free and open source on Github</a>, and is used by FSU's College of Communication and Information.</p>

        <p><b>First, a quiz.</b> Is the following code valid in PHP5 or PHP7?</p>
        <code>$pageErrors[$field] = $err->toStr();</code>
        <br>
        <button type="button" onclick="PHP5()">PHP5</button>
        
        <button type="button" onclick="PHP7()">PHP7</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="CLEAR()">Clear</button>
        <hr>

        <div id="php5" style="display:none">
                        Correct! PHP5 didn't require typecasting, so functions like <code>toStr()</code> were common.
                        However, the correct PHP7 code is:
                        <br>
                        <code>$pageErrors[$field] = (string) $err;</code>
                </div>

        <div id="php7" style="display:none">
                                Incorrect! PHP5 didn't require typecasting. The correct PHP7 code would be:
                                <br>
                                <code>$pageErrors[$field] = (string) $err;</code>
        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
                function PHP5() {
                        document.getElementById('php5').style.display='block'
                }
                function PHP7() {
                        document.getElementById('php7').style.display='block'
                }
                function CLEAR() {
                        document.getElementById('php5').style.display='none'
                        document.getElementById('php7').style.display='none'
                }       
                </script>

        <p>Anyway, onto OpenBiblio. I used a tool called <a href="https://github.com/Alexia/php7mar">PHP 7 MAR (Migration Assistant Report).</a></p>
        <p>It looked like this:</p>
        <img src="img/php7mar.png" alt="PHP 7 to MAR" />
        <p>This tool was fantastic. Without it, I'd have to debug via the web browser, waiting for HTTP 500 errors and debugging from Apache logs.</p>
        <p>Thus, I painstakingly went function by function and changed them to PHP7 equivalents.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Finally, I was able to view my webpage and work on testing.</p>
        <p>Here's a photo of the interface:</p>
        <img src="img/interface.png" alt="PHP 7 to MAR" />
        <p>I worked with the Librarian and assistants to debug every feature. For example, the system would "crash" when entering an invalid barcode.</p>
        <p>My fix was primitive, but I didn't want to modify too much of the original code:</p>
        <img src="img/barcode.png" alt="Barcode error" />
        <p>As you can see, this isn't an elegant solution, but it's better than a blank page.</p>
        <p>Anyways, OpenBiblio is still a work in progress. As I find bugs, I push fixes to the Github page.</p>

        <div id="server">
        <h3>CCI HelpDesk Development Server</h3>
        <p>Another one of my projects is setting up an entire development environment for FSU's College of Communication and Information.
                 I started from racking servers and swapping RAM, to live-migrating Active Directory.</p>
                 <img src="img/server.jpeg" alt="Server Rack" />
                 <p>Our server rack is mainly composed of used Dell R620s. We also have a SAN with 10TB in RAID 5.  </p>
                 <p>My contribution to this project was setting everything up for my supervisors and colleagues to use. I acted as the sole system administrator in this Windows Server 2016 environment.</p>
                 <img src="img/aduc.png" alt="Active Directory" />
                 <h4>Challenges</h4>
                 <p>The largest challenge I faced was setting up a Failover Cluster, or allowing Virtual Machines (Hyper-V) to be Highly Available.</p>
                 <p>I spent months of the issue, and no matter what I did, the cluster would have weird issues, such as nodes failing, and the cluster storage was completely unreachable.</p>
                 <img src="img/luns.png" alt="LUNs" />
                 <p>What I did to debug:</p>
                 <ol>
                         <li>Completely wiped and re-imaged one server that was always having problems</li>
                         <li>Re-made the cluster 10+ times</li>
                         <li>Wiped and re-made all LUNs</li>
                         <li>Re-configured ISCSI initiators and targets multiple times</li>
                         <li>Setup a VLAN just for iSCSI traffic</li>
                         <li>Went past page two of Google Search Results (it's a scary place)</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>This was completed while I handled my HelpDesk technician responsibilities. After two months, I found the solution hidden in a 2015 post on Microsoft's forums.</p>
                 <p>Can you guess? Click below to reveal the answer.</p>
                 <button type="button" onclick="SOLUTION()">Solution</button>
                 <button type="button" onclick="CLEAR2()">Clear</button>
                 <div id="solution" style="display:none">
                                <br>

                                It was <b>Active Directory</b>. Two of the hosts in the cluster were Domain Controllers, and as soon as I demoted them, everything worked flawlessly. This is when I did an Active Directory migration from physical to virtual servers.

        <p>As of this writing, I'm still doing work on our server rack. My next goal is to setup Grafana and Prometheus for server monitoring.</p>
