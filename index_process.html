        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <p>Thank you for completing my coding challenge! Sadly, Github Pages can't run PHP, so I can't verify your
                answers. Let's hope they're correct.
        </p>
        <h3>OpenBiblio</h3>
        <p>To give you an example of my programming experience, I will be walking you through my work on OpenBiblio for PHP7.0.</p>
        <p>OpenBiblio is a library system that is free and open source. The web application was outdated, and ran only on PHP5 and an outdated MySQL version.</p>
        <p>My work is here, <a href="https://github.com/wbollock/openbiblio_7.2_php7">released free and open source on Github</a>, and is used by FSU's College of Communication and Information.</p>
        <p>First, a quiz. Is the following code valid in PHP5 or PHP7?</p>
        <code>$pageErrors[$field] = $err->toStr();</code>
        <br>
        <button type="button" onclick="PHP5()">PHP5</button>
        
        <button type="button" onclick="PHP7()">PHP7</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="CLEAR()">Clear</button>
        

        <div id="php5" style="display:none">
                        Correct! PHP5 didn't require typecasting, so functions like <code>toStr()</code> were common.
                        However, the correct PHP7 code is:
                        <br>
                        <code>$pageErrors[$field] = (string) $err;</code>
                </div>

        <div id="php7" style="display:none">
                                Incorrect! PHP5 didn't require typecasting. The correct PHP7 code would be:
                                <br>
                                <code>$pageErrors[$field] = (string) $err;</code>
        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
                function PHP5() {
                        document.getElementById('php5').style.display='block'
                }
                function PHP7() {
                        document.getElementById('php7').style.display='block'
                }
                function CLEAR() {
                        document.getElementById('php5').style.display='none'
                        document.getElementById('php7').style.display='none'
                }       
                </script>

        <p>Anyway, onto OpenBiblio. I used a tool called <a href="https://github.com/Alexia/php7mar">PHP 7 MAR (Migration Assistant Report).</a></p>
        <p>It looked like this:</p>
        <img src="img/php7mar.png" alt="PHP 7 to MAR" />
        <p>This tool was fantastic. Without it, I'd have to debug via the web browser, waiting for HTTP 500 errors and debugging from Apache logs.</p>
        <p>Thus, I painstakingly went function by function and changed them to PHP7 equivleants.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Finally, I was able to view my webpage and work on testing.</p>
        <p>Here's a photo of the interface:</p>
        <img src="img/interface.png" alt="PHP 7 to MAR" />
        <p>I worked with the Libranian and assistants to debug every feature. For example, the system would "crash" when entering an invalid barcode.</p>
        <p>My fix was primitive, but I didn't want to modify too much of the original code:</p>
        <img src="img/barcode.png" alt="Barcode error" />
        <p>As you can see, this isn't an elegant solution, but it's better than a blank page.</p>
        <p>Anyways, OpenBiblio is still a work in progress. As I find bugs, I push fixes to the Github page.</p>
